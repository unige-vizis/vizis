      <h3>Global Conflict Patterns in the Context of Economic Compositions</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Analysis of conflict data from the last 10 years (2015-2024)</p>

        <p>
          This analysis examines how the composition of a country's economic sectors relates to its conflict patterns.
          Every country has a unique economic structure, often dominated by certain economic areas such as agriculture,
          manufacturing, or services. The distribution of these sectors can influence social stability, resource
          allocation, and vulnerabilities. For our analysis, we use the four-sector-model, which devides economies in
          four main sectors: primary sector, secondary sector, tertiary sector, and tourism sector.
        </p>
        <p class="main-message">
          Our goal is to show, whether resource-dependent economies exhibit different conflict pattern compared to
          industrial or service economies.
