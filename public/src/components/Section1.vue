      <h2>Global Conflict Patterns in the Context of Economic Compositions</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          This analysis examines how the composition of a country's economic sectors relates to its conflict patterns.
          Using ACLED event data and economic sector classifications (primary, secondary, tertiary sectors), we compare
          the frequency, severity, and type of conflicts in countries with different industrial structures. Our
          visualizations show whether resource-dependent economies exhibit different conflict patterns than diversified
          industrial or service economies, thereby contributing to a broader discussion on the relationship between
          economic structure and violence.
