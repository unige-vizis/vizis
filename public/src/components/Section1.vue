      <h3>Global Conflict Patterns in the Context of Economic Compositions</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Analysis of conflict data from the last 10 years (2015-2024)</p>

          This analysis examines how the composition of a country's economic sectors relates to its conflict patterns.
          Every country has a unique economic structure, often dominated by certain economic areas such as agriculture
          or services. The distribution of these sectors can influence social stability, resource allocation, and
          vulnerabilities. For our analysis, we devide economies in this sectors: primary, secondary, tertiary, and
          tourism.

        <strong>For our project we use these datasets:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) - conflict events, fatalities, and event types
            (2015-2024)
          </li>
          <li>World Bank - economic sector composition, GDP in USD, and population statistics</li>
          <li>UN Tourism - tourism percentage data (SDG 8.9.1, 2008-2023)</li>
        </ul>

          Our goal is to show, whether resource-dependent economies exhibit different conflict pattern compared to
          industrial or service economies.
