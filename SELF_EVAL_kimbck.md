#Self-Evaluation about Web Programming (Kim Benecken) 
I am one of the erasmus students this semester in Genova. I am from Germany, where I  study primary school education. 
I have not yet created my own complete website, but during school i participated in a  "Homepage" working group where I gained first insights into web design. 
My experince with HTML, CSS and JavaScript is therefore at a beginner level but i am very interested in learning how to create websites and apply data visualization techniques. 
My strength are in working with data and explaining results clearly. 
My learning goals are to build confidence in structuring simple websites, embedding charts, and understanding basic web technologies such as GitHub Pages and simple JavaScript libraries.
