**First ideas for the Introduction (Human Suffering)**
 
Religion and geopolitics are deeply interwoven. Religious beliefs can unite societies, but they can also trigger conflict, shape poltical agendasa and influence international relations. When religion intersecs with geopolitical interests, tensions often escalate and extend far beyond governments or borders. 
The consequences are not only political but profoundly human. Such conflicts frequently cause violence, displacement, repression, and long lasting insecurity, all of which contribute to human suffering on a large scale. This project examines how religion shapes geopolitical events and explores the ways in which this interaction increases human suffering across different regions of the world. 

This project examines how religion shapes geopolitical events and explores the ways in which this interaction increases human suffering across different regions of the world. By comparing different countries, regions, and types of conflict events, we aim to reveal both similarities and differences in the role of religion, and to show how these dynamics vary in scale and intensity.


Comparison CHARTS 
 
1. Bar Chart
•	Message: Countries with the highest number of religion-related violent events.
•	Connection to human suffering: Shows where religion-related violence is most concentrated, indicating where civilians face the greatest risks.

2. Grouped Bar Chart
•	Message: Compare two regions (e.g., Middle East vs. Sub-Saharan Africa) across two years (e.g., 2020 vs 2023).
•	Connection to human suffering: Demonstrates how intensity of religion-related conflict – and therefore civilian suffering – shifts across regions and time.

3. Heatmap
•	Message: Monthly frequency of religion-related protests across different countries.
•	Connection to human suffering: Highlights temporal patterns, showing peaks when populations experience heightened instability or repression.

4. 100% Stacked Bar Chart
•	Message: Share of event types (protests, violence against civilians, battles) in religion-related events.
•	Connection to human suffering: Shows not only that conflicts occur, but also whether suffering comes more from direct violence, mass protests, or state repression.
